## Raplybot
A bot that turns a mention to [raplybot](twitter.com/raplybot) into a rhyming collection of text with added yo's.

Project started to learn about automising a twitter bot and general python syntax. 
The idea is to also use machine learning so that it will generate vaguely original content based on replies it gets.

## Currently
- Only sends a tweet if I activate the script
- Only adds yo's to the tweet.


## TODO: 
- Automate the bot.
- Find a proper dataset.
- Machine learn what rhymes in english based on the found dataset.



## Learning
To boot I started with src1

When I wanted to learn how to automate the bot I used src2 and src2.
